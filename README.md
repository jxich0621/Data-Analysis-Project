# Data-Analysis-Project
Used the price data of 20 individual stocks from June 2014 to June 2018 on Yahoo Finance, and took the first 15% data as model prior. Dynamically updated the mean return and the covariance matrix of the 20 stocks given the prior and got the optimal asset allocation for the 20-stock portfolio given the mean and volatility for each individual asset at each time.
